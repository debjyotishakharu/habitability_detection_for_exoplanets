# Exoplanet Habitability Prediction Project
This project focuses on predicting the habitability of exoplanets using machine learning techniques in Python. The prediction models utilize various algorithms to analyze and classify exoplanetary data sourced from the "Habitable Worlds Catalog" provided by the Planetary Habitability Laboratory.

# Overview
The project consists of two main phases: data preprocessing and model prediction. In the data preprocessing phase, the provided exoplanetary data is cleaned, formatted, and prepared for analysis. Subsequently, in the model prediction phase, several machine learning algorithms are employed to classify the habitability status of the exoplanets based on the processed data.

# Data Source
The primary data source for this project is the "Habitable Worlds Catalog" obtained from the Planetary Habitability Laboratory. This dataset contains relevant features and characteristics of exoplanets necessary for habitability prediction.

# Models Used
The following machine learning models are implemented in this project:

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Naive Bayes
XGBoost
LightGBM

# To run the project:
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Python installed, along with the necessary libraries.
Execute the Planet_Habitability_Detection.ipynb notebook to preprocess the data and train the prediction models.
Evaluate the performance of each model based on relevant metrics.
Experiment with different models and parameters to optimize performance further.
